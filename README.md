# Better Trading Bot Rules

1. Invests random amount
2. If value of investment raises >= 10% of original purchase then profit is sold and reinvested
3. If value of original investment drops below original buying price then more coin is bought at random
4. If value of original investment drops more than 5% of the original buying value then the entire amount is pulled and the bot waits 12 hours before it starts trading again to minimize losses
